[rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) + [d3.js Parallel Coordinates](http://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/)
=================

This [parallel coordinates](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates) library for [d3.js](http://d3js.org)
is so powerful that I view as an absolutely necessary component of my interactive visualization toolset.  Of course,
my toolset is very dependent on [rCharts](http://rcharts.io), so I am guessing that many of the experiments will involve
some rCharts.


Here is a [great video](http://youtu.be/ypc7Ul9LkxA) on parallel coordinates at the 2013 Openvis Conference.
